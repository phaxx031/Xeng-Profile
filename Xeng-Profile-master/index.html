 <h1>I wanted to get into web development to build a tool that can change the world, or at the very least, make my life much simpler. I'm super excited to see who I meet along the way and discover how we can help eachother. As a licensed mental health practitioner, I understand the importance for human connection and teamwork. I'm slowly learning web development and all things related to coding. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my little brother, playing video games, exercising and planning my next getaway!</h1>
